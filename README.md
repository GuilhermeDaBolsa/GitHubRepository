## What does SimplY offers to you?

## Shapes:  (Rectangle, Circle, Line, Polygon and Text)

All basics shapes were standardized and improved in this library, for example: 
The stroke is now considered for every transformation, like translating or resizing;
The translating method now allows the programer to chose the pivo point for translating the shape (0 - left / up | 1 - right / down);
The stroke is now calculated properly (it is not just it's thickness);
The resize methods are not dependent from the shape (they are the same for all shapes);
etc...
