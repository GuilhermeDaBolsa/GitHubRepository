# What is SimplY?

* It is a short JavaFX library that manages to simplify the work needed to build an app;

* Work with visual elements, but it also offers some non-visual classes (for logic stuff);

* Help enshorting programming time and getting rid of some issues that you might face sometimes;

* Only uses Java and JavaFX, so it is stable and fast.

* Have a complete JAVADOC (it is in english).


# What does SimplY offers to you?

### Shapes:  (Rectangle, Circle, Line, Polygon and Text)

All basics shapes were standardized and improved in this library, for example: 
* The stroke is now considered for every transformation, like translating or resizing;
* The translating method now allows the programer to chose the pivo point for translating the shape (0 - left / up | 1 - right / down);
* The stroke is now calculated properly (it is not just it's thickness);
* The resize methods are not dependent from the shape (they are the same for all shapes);
* etc...
