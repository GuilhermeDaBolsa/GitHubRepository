# What is SimplY?

* It is a short JavaFX library that manages to simplify the work needed to build an app.

* Work with visual elements, but it also offers some non-visual classes (for logic stuff).

* Help enshorting programming time and getting rid of some issues that you might face sometimes.

* Only uses Java and JavaFX, so it is stable and fast.

* Have a complete JAVADOC (it is in english).


# What does SimplY offers to you?

### Shapes:  (YRectangle, YCircle, YLine, YPolygon and YText)

All basics shapes were standardized and improved in this library, for example: 
* The stroke is now considered for every transformation, like translating or resizing.
* The translating method now allows the programer to chose the pivo point for translating the shape (0 - left / up | 1 - right / down).
* The stroke is now calculated properly (it is not just it's thickness).
* The resize methods are not dependent from the shape (they are the same for all shapes).
* etc...

### Elements created with the standardized shapes:

* **YBox**: It is a Shape that contains a Node inside.

* **YTable**: It is a much simpler table, where the programer only needs to especify the row and the colum.

* **YMenuTable**: It is a especified table, where the programer defines some initial rules and then only adds the elements.

* **YSlidingBar**: It is a sliding bar that holds almost every kind of path for its slider.

* **YMathGrid**: It is a math grid, like the name sugests, where it is possible to add elements in determined coordinates.
